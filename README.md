# Harmonic-enhancement-via-HPSS-and-EEMD

1) This repository consists of preprocessing pipeline for harmonic enhancement including harmonic source separation (HPSS) and ensemble empirical mode decomposition (EEMD), preserving high-frequency components of oscillatory signals (waveform). The function consist of multiple flags to play with each preprocessing step.
2) Blink artifact reduction (BARE) function to replace blink artifacts with the envelope within the interquartile range.

These functions were developed as part of the study detailed below. If you use this code in your research, please cite our work:
