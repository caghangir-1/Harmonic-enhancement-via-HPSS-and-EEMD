# Harmonic-enhancement-via-HPSS-and-EEMD

This repository consists of preprocessing pipeline for harmonic enhancement including harmonic source separation (HPSS) and ensemble empirical mode decomposition (EEMD), preserving high-frequency components of oscillatory signals (waveform). The function consist of multiple flags to play with each preprocessing step.
