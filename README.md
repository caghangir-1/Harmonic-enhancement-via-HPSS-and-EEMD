# Harmonic-enhancement-via-HPSS-and-EEMD

This repository consists of two modules, including:

1) Preprocessing pipeline for harmonic enhancement, preserving high-frequency components of oscillatory signals (waveform).
2) The dual- input learner deep learning model includes 2D CNN and bidirectional LSTM as two separate branches being merged into the final dense layer for the prediction.

Please cite the study stated below if you use one of the modules:
