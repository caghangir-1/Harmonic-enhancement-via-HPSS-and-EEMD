# Harmonic-enhancement-via-HPSS-and-EEMD

1) This repository consists of preprocessing pipeline for harmonic enhancement including harmonic source separation (HPSS) and ensemble empirical mode decomposition (EEMD), preserving high-frequency components of oscillatory signals (waveform). The function consist of multiple flags to play with each preprocessing step.
2) Blink artifact reduction (BARE) function to replace blink artifacts with the envelope within the interquartile range.

Please cite the study stated below if you use the harmonic enhancement or BARE functions:
